        question:"How do I place an order",
        answer:"You may place an order through our website; by calling us at (919) 856-0604. Photographs may be e-mailed to us at info@edibleartnc.com."

        question:"Where can I find your pricing",
        answer:"Please call or e-mail us for pricing. Pricing varies depending on the design elements, size and flavor, so it would not be practical to list pricing for every cake we are capable of doing."

        question:"I've heard that I need to place my order weeks in advance in order for you to help me?",
        answer:"We recommend ordering at least a 1 days in advance for simpler designs and at least 2 days in advance for more complex designs."

    },
    {
        id:4,
        question:"What makes your products different.",
        answer:"Well, you might have read once or twice that we are a pure veg bakery, and that fact alone sets apart from most other bakeries. This improves the taste and quality of the products we make. Our desserts are not made in factories like those you might purchase from some grocery store bakeries. We never freeze our cakes, though that too is a common practice"
